1. Identify 3 QAs for each system
  
  a. Enterprise Inventory Control: Performance, Modifiability, Integration
  b. Smart Phone Map App: Performance, Usability, Availability
  c. Video Game：Performance, Security, Testability
  d. Social Network Site: Security, Usability, Performance
  
2. Specify the most important QA for each system using scenario
  
  a. Enterprise Inventory Control: 
  
    Performance
  
    Source              : Users
    Stimulus            : Initiate transactions
    Artifact            : system
    Environment         : Under normal operations
    Response            : Transactions are processed
    Response Measure    : With average latency of two seconds
  
  b. Smart Phone Map App: 
  
    Usability
    
    Source              : Users
    Stimulus            : minimize impact of errors
    Artifact            : system
    Environment         : at runtime
    Response            : cancel current operations
    Response Measure    : cancellation takes less than one second
    
  c. Video Game：
  
    Testability
    
    Source              : Unit tester
    Stimulus            : performs unit test
    Artifact            : component of the system
    Environment         : at completion of the component
    Response            : component has interface for controlling behavior and output is observable.
    Response Measure    : path coverage of 85% is archieved within three hours
  
  d. Social Network Site: 
  
    Security
    
    Source              : Correctly identified individual
    Stimulus            : tries to modify information
    Artifact            : data within the system
    Environment         : under normal operations
    Response            : system maintain audit trail
    Response Measure    : correct data is restored within a day
